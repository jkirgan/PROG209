            <p id="output">With a snicker-snack of your magical spear you delt blow after blow to the creature.  Its claws sought to rend you but your shield had a mind of its own and met them mid swing time and time again.  In the end it drew one last ragged breath, blood flecking its spittle, and died a quiet death fitting for a creature of the shadows.  The child you found is the only living soul who will ever believe you and with her parents dead you are now her sole guardian. Years later you and that child live a more peaceful life and when asked about your mementos you laugh them off as if they aren’t anything special.  But you both know and someday you will hand those tools down to her for if another creature takes up residence in the undercroft someone will need to deal with it.</p>
